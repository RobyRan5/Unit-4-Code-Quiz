# Unit-4-Code-Quiz

I was able to formulate the quesitons and the assignment layout. 

However I did run out of time trying to get it all together. I tried several attemtps with groups and on my own and I did a little better on my own. 

I was unable to get the timer to work and my JS quesitons would not populate. I tried several troubleshooting methods but was unable to complete the full assignment on time. 

Thank you for your continued feedback and support.
